- **Question Count**: 8 questions per module
- **Pass Requirement**: 6 out of 8 correct answers (75%)
- **Color Scheme**: Red (#ff6b6b)

## File Naming Convention

All module files follow this naming pattern:
```
[topic-slug]-[level].html
```

Examples:
- `introduction-derivatives-novice.html`
- `introduction-derivatives-intermediate.html`
- `introduction-derivatives-advanced.html`
- `rules-of-differentiation-novice.html`
- `rules-of-differentiation-intermediate.html`
- `rules-of-differentiation-advanced.html`

## Module Features

### Individual Module Pages
Each module includes:
- **Level Badge**: Visual indicator of difficulty level

- **JavaScript ES6+**: Modern JavaScript with modules
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach

### Backend Integration
- **Firebase Authentication**: User login/logout management
- **Firestore Database**: Progress tracking and user data
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant progress synchronization
- **Session Storage**: Local caching for better performance

### Progress Tracking
Each module completion is tracked with:
- **Module Name**: Specific topic and level
- **Score Percentage**: Calculated based on correct answers
- **Completion Status**: Pass/Fail based on requirements
- **Timestamp**: When the module was completed

## User Experience Flow

1. **Assessment**: User takes the main quiz to identify weak areas
2. **Recommendations**: System suggests specific topics to focus on
3. **Module Selection**: User can choose from three difficulty levels
4. **Learning**: Complete modules at appropriate difficulty
5. **Progress Tracking**: View completion status and scores
6. **Advancement**: Move to higher levels as skills improve
